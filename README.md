# BitsyDB-Project

CSC 4710 Database Project

We designed and implemented a database system using a relational database management system. 

Phase 1: determine our entities and identify the database requirements

Phase 2: derive ER model by draw partial ER Diagrams (conceptual) using requirements by finding entities, attributes, and relationships between. Identify constraints, primary keys, foreign keys. 

Phase 3: Map from conseptual schema (ER model) to relational schema

Phase 4: perform normalization on relations ensuring third normal form (3NF)

Phase 5: Create proper data dictionary

Phase 6: Implement and create database using 'create table', 'insert', or loading tools
